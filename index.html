      <h1>The Morality of Abortion and a Potential Middle Ground</h1>
      <h2>An Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        It's no question that there's a lot of controversial opinions regarding
        abortion, and the morality of it. It's something that sparks debate from
        both sides. On one hand, we have pro-life people. Their belief advocates
        for the survival of any pregnancy, usually under any circumstance. On
        the other side, we have pro-choice people. Their belief usually consists
        of the saying "my body my choice". They widely believe the decision to
        keep, or to abort a child is completely up to the mother. Because of
        these vastly differing opinions, it is often hard to find a middle
        ground. This website is to discuss, view the opposing sides, and most
        importantly, come to a middle ground in this conversation. I think it's
        important we try to come together and understand why someone might have
        an opposing opinion. The only way we can grow as a society is to have
        these meaningful discussions regardless of the topic.

      <h2>Pro Life</h2>
      <p>
        The pro-life perspective mainly centers their belief that all life has
        value regardless of what stage of life they are at. Any child is worthy
        of dignity and worth, even if unborn. They argue it is morally wrong to
        intentionally take the life of an innocent child, regardless of the
        circumstances. There are also some who argue for the concern of the
        woman's well-being when going through the abortion process. Some believe
        abortion should not be a solution to an unwanted pregnancy, as it can
        have long-term damaging effects on the mother's physical and emotional
        health. Another major factor of being pro-life is the belief in
        religion. Many pro-life people base their stance based off of their
        religious upbringing which emphasize the importance of protecting the
        unborn. While this video has supporters of both pro-life and pro-choice
        people, there is a nice sentiment from
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LU6VVykDV8"
          >this YouTube video</a
        >. The quote is "I think that al humans have human right by nature of
        being a human."

    <div class="pro-choice">
      <h2>Pro Choice</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to pro-choice believers, they advocate for autonomy and
        bodily integrity. There is the vast belief that women should be entitled
        to their own bodies, and have the choice to do what they'd like with it.
        Opposing the view of pro-life believers, they believe there is religious
        freedom, meaning they do not have to follow pro-lifer's beliefs and
        customs. Pro-choice people often advocate for preventative pregnancy and
        education. Meaning having a better access to education and healthcare.
        They argue that by providing accurate information, and access to
        affordable contraception, could reduce the amount of unintended
        pregnancies as well as the need for abortions. "These are vulnerable
        girls, and it's just heartbreaking to see the number of pregnant
        13-year-olds I've had to take care of." can really resonate with someone
        when the thought that a literal child is pregnant.

      <h2>The Potential Middle Ground and Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        While it may often be difficult to sway someone's beliefs, that might
        not always need to be the goal for some. In the article
        <a

          href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/23/nx-s1-5175084/cousins-divided-on-abortion-find-ways-to-support-each-other"
          >Cousins Divided on Abortion Find Ways to Support Each Other</a
        >, Kayla Meyers and Tori LaBelle have different opinions regarding
        abortion. Meyers and LaBelle grew up in similar households. They're
        cousins who were brought up religiously, believing abortion is wrong
        under any circumstances. That was until Meyers started attending college
        and had a change of opinion. She had a child and went through severe
        postpartum depression. She understood motherhood is not for everyone,
        and it can often be a challenge to some to carry out a pregnancy.
        LaBelle on the other hand, remained firm with her position that abortion
        is wrong, but she doesn't fault Meyers for it. They have been able to
        come together and realize they can still love each other regardless of
        opinion. They've been able to come to a middle ground. Affordable
        healthcare, affordable childcare, paid parental leave for mothers and
        fathers, government programs and non profit support are all resources
        that can help mother's. It's not easy to have a child in this economy by
        any means, which often leads to abortion. My middle ground is, if you
        are religious, there is nothing wrong with following your beliefs. There
        is also no reason or validity to shame another person for not sharing
        that belief. For the people rallying outside of clinics that carry out
        abortions, find something better to do with your time. Support the non
        profit organizations, adopt a child in the foster care system, or even
        better, personally help the mother who's abortion you are trying to
        prevent instead of shaming them. We don't know anyone's personal
        situation other than our own, so it's best to keep an open mind.
